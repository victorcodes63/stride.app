# Eagle HR — System functionality overview

This document describes **what the application does today**, based on the codebase (dashboard routes, public pages, APIs, and Prisma models). Items marked **placeholder** or **coming soon** are present in the UI or schema but are not fully implemented end-to-end.

## Platform summary

| Area | Role |
|------|------|
| **Public site** | Marketing, services, careers board, resources, contact |
| **Staff dashboard** | Recruitment ATS, interviews, outsourcing HR/payroll, internal staff leave, accounts/billing, users, insights CMS |
| **Candidate flows** | Apply for jobs (multi-stage application), interview confirm / reschedule / withdraw via token links |
| **Data & stack** | Next.js App Router, PostgreSQL (Prisma), optional Vercel Blob for uploads, email for applications/contact/interviews |

---

## 1. Public website (marketing)

- **Home, About, Services** — Brand pages, animations (Framer Motion), responsive layout.
- **Contact** — Contact form backed by API (`/api/contact`) with validation; aligns with email setup docs.
- **Careers** — Lists active job openings; links to application flows.
- **Insights** — Public listing (`/insights`) and article-style pages (`/insights/[slug]`) fed from the `Insight` model / API.

- **Legal** — Privacy and terms pages.
- **SEO & performance** — Metadata, structured layout; standard Next.js optimizations.

---

## 2. Candidate experience (job board & applications)

- **Job records** — Rich job model: title, location, type, category, description, requirements/responsibilities/benefits (JSON), skills, salary (optional public display), experience/education filters, client linkage, confidential posting, application window (start/deadline), reference IDs and slugs.
- **Apply** — `/careers/apply/[id]` application flow with CV/certificate uploads (Blob in production, local `public/uploads` in dev when Blob is not configured).
- **Applications** — `Application` + `Candidate` models; statuses: pending, reviewed, shortlisted, rejected, hired; internal notes; structured `formData` for extended questionnaire stages.
- **Application views** — Staff “who has opened this application” tracking (`ApplicationView`).
- **Exports & bulk actions** (staff) — Application export API, bulk CV download, bulk rejection sending (API routes under `/api/applications/...`).

---

## 3. Authentication & users

- **Staff dashboard auth** — Login, logout, session/me endpoint; Microsoft OAuth start/callback routes; forgot-password flow (see `AUTH.md`).
- **Roles** — `UserRole`: admin, staff, viewer.
- **Staff personas** — `StaffUserType` (operations, business_manager, finance, director) for permission-sensitive features (e.g. executive analytics, leave approvers).
- **Staff user management** — `/dashboard/users/staff` for creating/managing internal accounts and Accounts module permissions (`AccountsStaffAccess`: contracts, invoices, payments, vendors scoped per client or global).
- **Recruitment client portal users** — Separate `RecruitmentClientPortalUser` records (email/password) tied to a recruitment `Client`; admin UI at `/dashboard/users/recruitment-clients` and CRUD APIs. **Dedicated employer sign-in UX can be wired later** (data model and admin tools exist).

---

## 4. Recruitment (ATS) — staff dashboard

- **Clients** — Recruitment employer clients (`Client`): contact details, anonymous/confidential display options; link to optional `AccountsClient` and portal users.

- **Official letter / PDF** — Optional storage path for government-style invite attachments.

---

## 6. Executive analytics

- **Analytics dashboard** (`/dashboard/analytics`) — Restricted to admin or Director-type staff; charts and metrics over jobs, applications (by status/month), interviews, and drill-down behaviour (client-side data loading from existing APIs).

---

## 7. People & HR (internal staff)

- **Staff leave** — Leave types (API + admin), balances, applications, approval workflow APIs (`/api/staff/leave/...`); dashboard page `/dashboard/staff-leave`.
- **Assigned tasks** — **Placeholder** page only (no task model wired yet).
- **Performance** — **Placeholder** page only.
- **Contracts (HR view)** — Navigation and copy describe contract monitoring; **detail page is stub** (“wire-up next”). Financial/contracts of record live under **Accounts** (see below) with reminders; this area is the cross-link / future HR-facing contract hub.

---

## 8. Outsourcing module (client HR operations)

- **Clients** — `OutsourcingClient` with Kenya tax IDs, banking, billing metadata, contract dates, payroll frequency, leave pay modes.
- **Departments** — Nested under outsourcing clients; employee assignments.

- **Leave (outsourced employees)** — **Data model exists** (`LeaveType`, `LeaveBalance`, `LeaveApplication`) **but dashboard UI is “coming soon”** at `/dashboard/outsourcing/leave`.
- **Attendance** — **Data model exists** (`Attendance`) **but dashboard UI is “coming soon”** at `/dashboard/outsourcing/attendance`.

### 9.2 Sales invoices & credit notes

- **Invoices** — Line items ex-VAT, VAT rate (basis points), issue/due/tax dates, **payment bank** variant (payroll vs consultancy block on PDF), status **unpaid / partial / paid** driven by **allocations + credit notes** vs total.

- **Credit notes** — Issue against an existing invoice (wizard + POST API); per-client numbering; lines with VAT; **CREDIT NOTE** PDFs; caps so credited amount cannot exceed invoice; **balance due** = total − allocated receipts − credits; invoice status recomputation includes credits.
- **Invoice export** — Export API for reporting.

### 9.3 Receipts & allocations
